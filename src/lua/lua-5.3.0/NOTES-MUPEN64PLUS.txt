This is the standard Lua 5.3.0 source package from
http://www.lua.org/download.html, with one modification:
"-fPIC added to CFLAGS" in src/Makefile, to be able to statically link
liblua.a into the Mupen64Plus core plugin.

The default settings in luaconf.h aren't changed, so this Lua builds with
compatibility flags for Lua 5.2 (but not 5.1).
